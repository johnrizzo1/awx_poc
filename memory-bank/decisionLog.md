# Decision Log

This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.

2025-10-15 14:54:57 - Memory Bank initialized.

## Decision

*   Initialized Memory Bank system for project context management

## Rationale 

*   Provides structured approach to maintaining project context across sessions
*   Enables better collaboration and knowledge transfer
*   Tracks decisions, progress, and patterns systematically

## Implementation Details

*   Created five core files: productContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md, decisionLog.md, and systemPatterns.md
*   Each file serves a specific purpose in maintaining project knowledge

[2025-10-15 15:10:58] - Project Implementation Completed

## Decision

*   Completed full implementation of AWX POC infrastructure
*   Selected Docker Compose installation method for AWX
*   Implemented comprehensive automation and documentation

## Rationale

*   Docker Compose chosen over AWX Operator for:
  - Simpler setup and maintenance
  - Lower resource requirements
  - Faster deployment for POC purposes
  - Easier troubleshooting
*   Multi-OS client setup demonstrates AWX's cross-platform capabilities
*   Comprehensive documentation ensures easy adoption and troubleshooting

## Implementation Details

*   Infrastructure: Vagrant + VirtualBox + Ansible
*   4 VMs: 1 AWX server (AlmaLinux 9) + 3 clients (AlmaLinux, Ubuntu, CentOS)
*   Network: Private network 192.168.56.0/24
*   AWX Version: 24.6.1 via Docker Compose
*   Automation: Complete playbooks for setup, installation, and configuration
*   Documentation: Setup guide, usage guide, troubleshooting guide
*   Quick-start script for automated deployment

## Outcomes

*   Fully functional AWX POC environment
*   Ready for immediate deployment and testing
*   Demonstrates comprehensive AWX capabilities
*   Includes demo scenarios and workflows
*   Complete documentation for all use cases

[2025-10-15 15:19:30] - Switched from VirtualBox to libvirt

## Decision

*   Changed virtualization provider from VirtualBox to libvirt
*   Updated all Vagrantfile provider configurations
*   Updated documentation to reflect libvirt usage

## Rationale

*   User preference for libvirt over VirtualBox
*   libvirt is more commonly used in enterprise Linux environments
*   Better integration with KVM on Linux systems
*   More suitable for production-like environments

## Implementation Details

*   Updated Vagrantfile: Changed all provider blocks from "virtualbox" to "libvirt"
*   Removed VirtualBox-specific customizations (natdnshostresolver1, natdnsproxy1)
*   Updated memory/CPU settings to use libvirt syntax (integers instead of strings)
*   Updated README.md prerequisites section
*   Updated docs/SETUP.md with libvirt installation instructions
*   Updated docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md with libvirt-specific troubleshooting
*   Updated quick-start.sh to check for libvirt and vagrant-libvirt plugin

## Impact

*   Users must install libvirt and vagrant-libvirt plugin instead of VirtualBox
*   All functionality remains the same
*   Better performance on Linux hosts with KVM

[2025-10-15 15:23:53] - Refactored Vagrantfile for Scalability

## Decision

*   Refactored Vagrantfile to use configuration-driven approach
*   Implemented iteration-based client VM creation
*   Consolidated provisioning into single site.yml playbook

## Rationale

*   Eliminates code duplication for similar VM definitions
*   Makes it trivial to scale the number of clients of each type
*   Simplifies maintenance - change configuration, not code
*   Single provisioning block ensures all VMs are configured together
*   More professional and maintainable infrastructure as code

## Implementation Details

*   Added CLIENTS configuration hash at top of Vagrantfile:
  - Defines count, box, and base_ip for each client type
  - Easy to modify for different scales
*   Added resource allocation variables (AWX_MEMORY, AWX_CPUS, etc.)
*   Implemented loop to create clients dynamically:
  - Iterates over client types
  - Creates specified count of each type
  - Automatically assigns sequential IP addresses
  - Generates unique VM names (e.g., client-alma-1, client-alma-2)
*   Created site.yml master playbook:
  - Orchestrates all provisioning in correct order
  - Runs AWX prerequisites
  - Configures all client nodes
  - Provides clear completion summary
*   Single provisioning block at end of Vagrantfile:
  - Runs after all VMs are created
  - Provisions all machines in one operation
  - Automatically configures Ansible groups

## Benefits

*   Scale from 3 to 30+ clients by changing a single number
*   Add new OS types by adding to CLIENTS hash
*   Consistent IP addressing scheme
*   Reduced Vagrantfile size and complexity
*   Easier to understand and modify
*   Professional infrastructure as code practices
